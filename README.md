# Avionics


## Overview
Open source avionics application written in Rust for use with Valve's
Steam Deck and X-Plane 11 flight simulation software. The steam deck is
a powerful machine with gamepad peripherals and a built in screen
capable of running X-Plane 11 at lower graphics and costs less than the
minimum dedicated graphics card required to by X-Plane's system
requirements.

This work-in-progress application will provide at home cockpit builders
and student pilots with a more accessible cost to having their own
personal flight simulator at home. By using this application with
ForeFlight and a dedicated external monitor, a student pilot can make
better use of their ground studies by simulating airport procedures,
applying checklist, and in-flight maneuvers in real time. Better
preparing student pilots for their dual training with a flight
instructor which may reduce the overall cost of flight training.
